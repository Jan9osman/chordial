## üé• Demo

### üîê Login Page

Notes: There's no error checking for the Login so while testing you can leave these fields blank and it will take you to the Profile Page. However, upon clicking the "Don't have an account? Sign Up," there is minimal error checking for the form for things such as valid email address, all fields being filled in, and password length. Additionally, to test the Login Page out, you will be able to navigate to the Profile Page by clicking the blue Login button or opening up the Login with Spotify modal.
